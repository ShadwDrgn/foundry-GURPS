# foundry-GURPS
### What is this?
This is a basic system module for Foundry VTT.

### What is Foundry-VTT?
Foundry is an AWESOME virtual tabletop that lets people more easily play tabletop games like D&D or in this case GURPS online with their friends. It's got some amazing functionality for macros, maps, superbly impressive lighting capabilities, and much more. Check it out at https://foundryvtt.com/

### Isn't there already a GURPS system module for Foundry?
Yes. I'm sure it's just fine for many people, but the first thing I thought of when I opened my first Character sheet in it was "how do I use this?" I'm writing this system module as an effort to create something extremely easy to use that will also teach me more about how Foundry works behind the scenes.
